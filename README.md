Medical Data Analysis 🏥📊
A machine learning-driven approach to analyzing patient health data, identifying risk factors, and predicting medical outcomes.
Overview
This project applies data analysis & machine learning techniques to medical datasets to classify patients into high-risk vs. low-risk categories based on vitals such as blood pressure, heart rate, blood sugar, CKMB, and Troponin levels.
Features
✔ Health Risk Classification – Categorizes patients as High-Risk or Low-Risk based on medical parameters.
✔ Machine Learning Prediction – Uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict risk levels.
✔ Feature Importance Analysis – Identifies key factors contributing to health risks.
✔ Data Visualization – Creates heatmaps, scatter plots, and box plots for better insights.
Usage
💡 Load your medical dataset (CSV or Excel).
📈 Run the risk classification model to predict patient health status.
🔍 Visualize results using plots and feature importance analysis.
Machine Learning Approach
🚀 Model Used: Random Forest Classifier
📊 Input Features:
- Age
- Heart Rate
- Systolic BP
- Diastolic BP
- Blood Sugar
- CKMB
- Troponin
Results
✔ Achieves high accuracy in classifying patients as High-Risk or Low-Risk.
✔ Feature importance analysis shows Troponin & CKMB are key predictors.
